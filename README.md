# witny-daydream
As a part of the winter [Women in Technology and Entrepreneuship in NY](http://www1.cuny.edu/sites/women-in-technology/) internship, [Alanis](https://github.com/alanislugo), [Eram](https://github.com/EramM805), and [Michelle](https://github.com/michellechiq99) built a daydream application to learn more about some parts of VR development.
The 3 Mysterious doors
During the two weeks of our internship, we built a VR experience where the user will have to choose from 3 doors. The goal of the experience is to find the ‘escape door’ and to avoid the other two horrific experiences. The ‘escape door’ is randomly generated so you may not be lucky the second time around!
